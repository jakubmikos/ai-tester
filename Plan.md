## Technical Considerations

### Browser Configuration
- Chrome (primary)
- Firefox (secondary)
- Edge (tertiary)
- Mobile viewports for responsive testing

### Test Data Management
- Configuration-driven test data
- Environment-specific settings (dev, staging, prod)
- Secure handling of sensitive test data
- Data cleanup strategies

### Reporting and CI/CD
- Playwright HTML reports
- RoqnRolla test results
- Screenshot capture on failures
- Video recording for complex scenarios
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline

### Error Handling and Resilience
- Retry mechanisms for flaky tests
- Explicit waits and element location strategies
- Graceful handling of network issues
- Test environment validation

## Success Criteria

### Phase Completion Criteria
Each phase must meet these criteria before proceeding:
- All scenarios pass consistently (90%+ success rate)
- Code review completed
- Documentation updated
- Performance within acceptable limits

### Overall Project Success
- All 29 scenarios automated and passing
- Comprehensive test coverage of PerfectDraft functionality
- Maintainable and scalable test architecture
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline
